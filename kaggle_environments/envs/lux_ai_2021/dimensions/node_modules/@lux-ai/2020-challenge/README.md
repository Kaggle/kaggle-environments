# LuxDesign

This repository will hold the game logic file (the Design), all the public Docker images bots are run on, and starter kits for every language

Change this name some time later

## Getting Started

Install the design with

```
npm install -g lux-ai-challenge-2020
```

To run a match from command line, simply run

```
lux-ai-run path/to/bot path/to/otherbot
```

and the match will run with some logging and store error logs and a replay in a new `errorlogs` folder and `replays` folder

The `kits` folder in this repository holds all of the available starter its you can use to start competing and building an AI agent.

# Frontend PR validation pipeline for kaggle-environments
# Builds visualizers WITHOUT Docker image build, publishing, or accessing secrets
#
# Security: This file intentionally has NO secrets access to prevent
# secret exfiltration from untrusted PR authors.
#
# Triggered on pull requests that modify only TypeScript/web/visualizer files
# This is significantly faster than the backend build since it skips Docker image build

steps:
  # Build visualizers to validate frontend changes
